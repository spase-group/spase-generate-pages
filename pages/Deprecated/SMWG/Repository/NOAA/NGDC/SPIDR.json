        "Description": "The Space Physics Interactive Data Resource (SPIDR) is designed to allow a solar terrestrial physics customer to intelligently access and manage historical space physics data for integration with environment models and space weather forecasts. SPIDR is a distributed network of synchronous databases and 100% Java middle-ware servers accessed via the World Wide Web. By enabling easy data mirroring and eliminating the network bottlenecks associated with transcontinental links, the distributed system architecture is a key factor for low latency in multimedia data visualization and fast data delivery.",
