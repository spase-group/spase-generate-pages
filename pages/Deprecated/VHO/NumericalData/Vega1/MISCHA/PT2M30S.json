        "Description": "2.5-minute averaged magnetic field measurements from Vega 1.\n      \n      During the cruise phase from Earth to Venus (12/84-06/85) both Vega-1 and\nVega-2 spacecraft had one-axis orientation, i.e. the spacecraft X axis was\nmaintained sunward-pointing, while the spacecraft Y and Z axes rotated about the\nX axis. The spin phase of this rotation was not known, therefore the directions\nof By and Bz components are unknown. Magnetometer data for this period are\npresented in spacecraft coordinates as Br (directed radially from spacecraft to\nthe Sun), Bysc, Bzsc. From the providers: \"It is proposed to use for analysis of\nthe interplanetary magnetic field during this period the Br component and the\ntotal B=sqrt(Bxsc^2+Bysc^2+Bzsc^2). Bysc and Bzsc components are included in the\ndata, but keep in mind that the orientation of these axes is unknown. It can be\nconsidered as fixed during periods up to a few hours, so the data can be used to\nlook for IMF discontinues and IMF orientation variations.\"\n\n      After Venus flybys (June, 11-15, 1985) up to Comet Halley (March, 6 and 9, 1986)\nand sometimes later Vega-1 and Vega-2 had three-axis stabilized orientations.\nAfter-Venus magnetic field data are presented in spacecraft-centered solar ecliptic (SE)\ncoordinate system as Br, Bzse, Byse, B, where Br is directed from the spacecraft to \nthe Sun, Bzse is directed along Bz axes of the Solar Ecliptic system (to ecliptic pole),\nByse completes the right handed set and B=sqrt(Br^2+By^2+Bz^2).",
