The rate\n          has 8 elements, each corresponding to a 45 degree range of the \n          spacecraft spin plane. The start of sector 1 (0 degrees) is coincident \n          with the spacecraft-generated Sun-pulse, and the start of each \n          subsequent sector is shifted by 45 degrees with respect to the preceding \n          sector.  For example, H45S1 covers the azimuthal range 0-45 degrees, \n          H45S2 covers the azimuthal range 45-90 degrees, etc.  In each sector,\n          counts are registered only when the axis of the telescope view cone is \n          within that sector.\n          Rate channel H45S is a coincidence counting rate requiring coincident\n          signals in detectors at least as deep in the stack as K1 (D7), \n          and no signals from detectors deeper in the stack than K6 (D12).  \n          Data from multiple spacecraft spins contribute to the counting rates \n          recorded for each sector, and the total accumulation time for the set of \n          H45S1-H45S8 rates is required to be an integral number of spacecraft \n          spins.

Counting rates reported here have a minimum \n          time resolution of one telemetry subcomm sequence (256 seconds at 1024 \n          bps, the most common science telemetry rate).
