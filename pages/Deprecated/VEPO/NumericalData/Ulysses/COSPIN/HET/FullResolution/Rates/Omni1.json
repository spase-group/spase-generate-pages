        "Description": "\n           A directory containing daily ftp-downloadable files containing readout-by-readout listings of \n           the counts accumulated in the H1-H9 spin-averaged counting rates. These counting rates respond \n           primarily to protons (H1-H5, H9) in the approximate energy ranges 5.4-14, 14-19, 24-31, 34-68,\n           68-92, and >92 MeV, respectively, and to electrons (H6-8) in the very approximate energy ranges \n           1-3, 5-10, and 3-5 MeV, respectively.\n           The naming convention for the daily files is uly_het_full_rat_omni1_YYYDDD.txt, where YYY \n           indicates the three-digit year since 1900 (e.g. YYY=090 for 1990, and YYY=102 for 2002) and \n           DDD indicates the three digit day of year (Jan. 1 = 1).\n           In each file, following a detailed description of the format, the data consist of a\n           listing of counts accumulated in the H1-H9 spin-averaged counting  rates during the intervals \n           between successive readouts, organized into columns as described below.\n           The first 4 columns give the start time of the counting rate accumulation period as\n           fractional year (to 12 decimal places) and as  year since 1900, day of year, and ms\n           of day at the start of the accumulation, followed by 1 column giving the duration of\n           the accumulation period in milli-seconds (it is the same for all 9 rates), and 9\n           columns giving the counts accumulated in that period for each rate.  All fields\n           except for the fractional year are in integer format.\n           Each line contains data for one single readout of the rates H1-H9, and all readouts\n           where at least one of the rates has a non-fill value are included.  Where fill\n           does occur it is indicated by -1.\n           Since the accumulation period for each readout is forced to include an integral number\n           of spacecraft spins in order to produce pure spin-averaged measurements, the lengths of\n           the accumulation periods vary in a cyclic manner as the period of the telemetry cycle\n           beats with the spacecraft spin period.  All counting rates in this file are read out\n           twice per spacecraft format.  At the most common science telemetry bit rate (2048 bps)\n           this corresponds to an average interval between readouts of 16 seconds.  Thus, with a\n           typical 5 rpm spacecraft spin rate the accumulation intervals vary in a repeating cycle of\n           12, 12, 24, 12, 12, 24, 12, etc. seconds.  At lower bit rates the average interval is\n           equal to 16x(2048/BR) seconds and the cycle automatically adjusts to produce this average\n           accumulation.\n           No noise-removal or despiking has been done, so caution must be used in interpreting isolated \n           large increases or decreases in the counting rates.\n       ",
