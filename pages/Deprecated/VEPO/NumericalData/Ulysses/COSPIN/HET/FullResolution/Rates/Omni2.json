        "Description": "\n           A directory containing daily ftp-downloadable files containing readout-by-readout listings of\n           the counts accumulated in the H1-H27 spin-averaged counting rates.  The rates H10-H13 are \n           coincidence counting rates corresponding primarily to heavy nuclei (Z>2) with penetrating\n           power equivalent to carbon-12 nuclei in the approximate energy ranges 26-36, 44-127, 127-173,\n           and >173 MeV/nucleon, resspectively.\n           H14-H27 are single detector counting rates giving, in order,  the total number of counts \n           above the lowest level discriminator thresholds of detectors D1-D6, K1-K6 (or D7-D12), \n           A (or D13), and the anti-coincidence scintillator S.  The single detector counting rates \n           are provided simply to assess the health of the detectors and are of little use \n           scientifically.\n           The naming convention for the daily files is uly_het_full_rat_omni2_YYYDDD.txt, where YYY \n           indicates the three-digit year since 1900 (e.g. YYY=090 for 1990, and YYY=102 for 2002) and \n           DDD indicates the three digit day of year (Jan. 1 = 1). \n           In each file, following a detailed description of the format, the data consist of a listing \n           of counts accumulated in the H10-H27 spin-averaged counting rates during the intervals\n           between successive readouts, organized into columns as described below.\n           The first 4 columns give the start time of the counting rate accumulation period as \n           fractional year (to 12 decimal places) and as  year since 1900, day of year, and ms \n           of day at the start of the accumulation, followed by 1 column giving the duration of \n           the accumulation period in milli-seconds (it is the same for all rates except H13, \n           which is read out twice in each accumulation period, and is thus represented as\n           H13a and H13b - see below and embedded documentation in each daily file), and 19 \n           columns giving the counts accumulated in that period for each rate.  All fields \n           except for the fractional year are in integer format.  The start time for H13a is\n           the time given  as the start time for the line, but (to sufficient accuracy) its \n           accumulation period is half the period given under \"coverage\".  Again, to sufficient \n           accuracy, the start time for H13b is the time given plus half the accumulation period, \n           and the accumulation period for H13b is half the period given under \"coverage\".\n           Each line contains data for one single readout of the rates H10-H12, H13a,\n           H13b, and H14-H27.  All readouts where at least one of the rates has a non-fill value \n           are included.  Where fill does occur it is indicated by -1. \n           Since the accumulation period for each readout is forced to include an integral number \n           of spacecraft spins in order to produce pure spin-averaged measurements, the lengths of \n           the accumulation periods vary in a cyclic manner as the period of the telemetry cycle \n           beats with the spacecraft spin period.  At the most common science telemetry rate, \n           2048 bps, each rate in this file is read out on average once every 128 seconds, except for \n           H13 which is readout on average twice in every 128 seconds.  At 2048 bps, the cycle of\n           accumulation periods is 132, 132, 120, 132, 132,, 120, 132, ... seconds.\n           No noise-removal or despiking has been done, so caution must be used in\n           interpreting isolated large increases or decreases in the counting rates.\n       ",

          "Description": "\n          H27 registers the total number of counts above threshold in the anti-coincidence \n          plastic scintillator, S, that surrounds the HET detector stack during the \n          accumulation period (column 5) starting at the time defined in columns 1-4.\n          No coincidence conditions are applied, so no particle identification can be made, nor \n          can any energy range be defined  other than that the particle (or gamma ray) must be \n          able to reach the detector either through the telescope aperture and overlying detector \n          stack, or through the side of the telescope and any spacecraft or instrument structure\n          in its path.  Consequently, the counting rate is most often dominated by high energy \n          cosmic rays and by electrons produced by gamma-rays in the telescope.  \n       ",
