Each subdirectory contains daily ascii files with naming convention\n           ucoshftaYYDDD.dat where YY and DOY are the two digit year and the three digit day of year\n           (Jan. 1 = 1).\n           Each file contains nominally 10-minute averages of HFT counting-rate-based fluxes of protons\n           and heavier nuclei from the COSPIN High Flux Telescope. The data are presented in flux units,\n           (s cmsq sr MeV/n)^-1.\n           Of the 22 data channels presented, 21 provide spin-averaged fluxes, and one proton channel\n           is accumulated in 32 spin-sectors.  Therefore each tab-delimited data record contains, in\n           addition to 5 integer time fields, 53 floating point fields of measured fluxes.\n           Since particle identification is based simply on energy losses exceeding discriminator thresholds\n           in a single 18 micron thick silicon solid state detector, explicit identification of nuclear charge\n           is not possible.  The channels are labeled with the usually dominant particle species, and may\n           contain significant contributions from heavier nuclei.\n           The contents of the 58 fields in each data record are described in the COSPIN/HFT User Notes\n           (http://helio.estec.esa.nl/ulysses/archive/cospin_hft_un.html)\n           referred to above.\n           (See also Anglin et al., J. Geophys. Res., 102, 1, 1997 for a further discussion of the HFT's function,,\n           especially in high flux environments.)\n           The thinness of the detector in combination with the discriminator threshold levels make the HFT\n           very insensitive to electrons.\n           The data cycle is complex (See Simpson et al., 1992, cited above), and, at the most common\n           science telemetry rate of 1024 bps, one complete data cycle is returned every 256 seconds.  Thus\n           at low bit rates (256 bps or lower) a full data cycle can not be completed in one 10 minute interval.\n           Fortunately, prior to loss of the Ulysses X-band transmitter in January 2008 periods where\n           such low bit rates were used were quite rare.\n           The accumulation intervals for all fluxes, both spin-averaged and sectored, are synchronized with\n           the spacecraft spin period so that each readout corresponds to an integral number of spins.\n        "
