            <Description>This data set contains 10-Minute averages of:
	                (a) spin-integrated count rates of protons (2.7-5.4, 5.4-23.1, 34.1-125.0, 125.0-320.0, 320.0-2100 and &gt;2100.0 MeV),
					    alpha particles (6.0-20.4, 34.2-125.0, 125.0-320.0, 320.0-2100.0 and &gt;2100.0 MeV/n) and
						electrons (2.5-7.0, 7.0-170.0 and &gt;170.0 MeV).
					(b)	8-sectored count rates of protons (5.4-23.1 MeV) and electrons (2.5-7.0 MeV);
					(c)	count rates of D10, D20, C10, C20 and A01 single detector sensors.  The parameter keys in the parameter-level segments below are specifically relevant to the UFA-accessible versions of the data.</Description>

           The README file at the Ulysses Final Archive (UFA) describes the
		   format of the ASCII data files containing 10-minute average proton,
		   helium and electron count rates and detector count rates for the COSPIN Kiel
		   Electron Telescope (KET), and caveats for their use.
