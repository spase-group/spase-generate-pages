        "Description": "This list of interplanetary sector boundary crossings,\nnow spanning 1926-2011, has been compiled by Leif Svalgaard from ground \nmagnetometer data and in situ interplanetary magnetic field observations \nIdentification of the boundaries is discussed at the \"InformationURL\" \ngiven below.  For each crossing, the day of crossing, the direction of \ncrossing (+to- or -to+) and the durations (in whole days) of single-polarity \nintervals on either side of the crossing are given.  As of early 2012, the \nlist was being kept current.",
