Version 1.1            \n      includes additional columns not present in the previous                 \n      version, 96 second rather than 48 second time samples, times            \n      converted to 'PDS Style' or 'Zulu time', and upgrading of PDS           \n      labels and templates to version 3.4. The SPICE based data that          \n      are also part of this data set were not previously archived             \n      with the PDS.

Two versions,             \n      both covering the same time period, but containing slightly             \n      different data, are provided. One version was generated by the          \n      Voyager MAG team from Voyager 2 SEDR, the other by the PDS/PPI          \n      node using the VG2_JUP.BSP and PCK00003.TCP SPICE kernels.              \n                                                                              \n      Due to inaccuracies in Voyager SEDR, as well as changes in the          \n      values of some key parameters (e.g. Jovian radius) the timing           \n      is improved for the SPICE generated data. However, since much           \n      of the original analysis was based upon the SEDR generated              \n      ephemeris, this data has been included as well.                         \n                                                                              \n      SEDR generated ephemeris                                                \n      ------------------------                                                \n      Instrument P.I.       : N/A                                             \n      Data Supplier         : NSSDC                                           \n      Data sampling rate    : 96 seconds                                      \n      Data Set Start Time   : 1979-07-05T00:00:47.269Z                        \n      Data Set Stop Time    : 1979-08-12T16:54:20.608Z                        \n                                                                              \n      SPICE generated ephemeris                                               \n      -------------------------                                               \n      Instrument P.I.       : N/A                                             \n      Data Supplier         : S.
