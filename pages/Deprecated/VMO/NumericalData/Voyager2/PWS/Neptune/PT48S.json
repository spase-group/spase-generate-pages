For each 48-second interval, a geometric       \n     average field strength is determined for each of the 16 spectrum         \n     analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to        \n     56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in frequency,        \n     four channels per decade.  The time associated with each set of          \n     averages is the beginning of the averaging interval.  Averages           \n     are stored in units of volt/meter.  During data gaps where               \n     complete 48-second intervals are missing, no entries exist in the        \n     file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any             \n     other way.
