                      <Description>This data set consists of
electric field waveform samples from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave
Receiver waveform receiver obtained during the Uranus encounter.
The waveforms are collections of 4-bit samples of the electric
field measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800
samples per second.  1600 samples are collected in 55.56 msec
followed by a 4.44-msec gap. Each 60-msec interval constitutes a
line of waveform samples. The data set includes about 271 frames of
waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, each.  The
telemetry format for the waveform data is identical to that for
images, hence the use of line and frame as constructs in describing
the form of the data.  The waveform is sampled through a bandpass
filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  The 4-bit samples
provide sixteen digital values of the electric field with a
linear amplitude scale, but the amplitude scale is arbitrary
because of the automatic gain control used in the waveform
receiver.  The instantaneous dynamic range afforded by the 4
bit samples is about 23 db, but the automatic gain control allows
the dominant signal in the passband to be set at the optimum
level to fit within the instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain
control, the overall dynamic range of the waveform receiver
is about 100 db.  The automatic gain control gain setting is not
returned to the ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration
for the data.  However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived
by Fourier transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by
the spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be
obtained in most cases.  The data may be plotted in raw form to
show the actual waveform; this is useful for studying events such
as dust impacts on the spacecraft.  But the normal method of
analyzing the waveform data is by Fourier transforming the samples
from each line to arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.
By stacking the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-
time spectrogram can be produced.
Additional information about this dataset and the instrument which
produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog.  An overview of
the data in this data set can be found in Gurnett et al. [1986] and
a complete instrument description can be found in Scarf and Gurnett
[1977].
