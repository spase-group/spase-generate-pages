Each 60-msec interval constitutes           \n    a line of waveform samples.  The data set includes frames of              \n    waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, or 48 seconds,            \n    each.  The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical            \n    to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as                    \n    constructs in describing the form of the data.                            \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Data Processing                                                             \n  ===============                                                             \n    Because there is no direct method for calibrating these data and          \n    because the raw format of packed, 4-bit samples is                        \n    space-efficient, these data are not processed for archiving.              \n    The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform;          \n    this is useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the            \n    spacecraft.  But the normal method of analyzing the waveform              \n    data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to             \n    arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.  By stacking            \n    the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-time                  \n    spectrogram can be produced.                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Data                                                                        \n  ====                                                                        \n    The waveforms are collections of samples of the electric field            \n    measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800               \n    samples per second.  The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital            \n    values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but           \n    the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain            \n    control used in the waveform receiver.  The instantaneous                 \n    dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 dB, but           \n    the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the              \n    passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the                 \n    instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain control, the overall          \n    dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 dB.  The              \n    automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the                \n    ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data.             \n    However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier            \n    transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the                 \n    spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained           \n    in most cases.                                                            \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Ancillary Data                                                              \n  ==============                                                              \n    None                                                                      \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Coordinates                                                                 \n  ===========                                                                 \n    The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole           \n    pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.          \n    However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured               \n    field to any particular direction such as the local magnetic              \n    field or direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft           \n    remains in a 3-axis stabilized orientation almost continuously,   ",
