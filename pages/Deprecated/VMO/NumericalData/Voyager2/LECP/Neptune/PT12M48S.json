This instrument          \n      measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles                   \n      ( >13 keV electrons and >24 keV ions) with various levels of            \n      discrimination based on energy range and mass species. A                \n      subset of almost 100 LECP channels are included in this data            \n      set. The LECP data are globally calibrated to the extent                \n      possible.  During Neptune far encounter, the entire LEPT                \n      (Low Energy Particle Telescope) and part of the LEMPA (Low              \n      Energy Magnetospheric Particle Analyzer) subsystems were                \n      turned on for data collection.  Particles include electrons,            \n      protons, alpha particles, and light, medium, and heavy nuclei           \n      particles.  The far encounter data are 12.8 minute rate and flux        \n      measurements within 1/8 of the LECP instrumental motor rotation         \n      period (the angular scanning periods, or step period).                  \n                                                                              \n      The LECP instrument has a rotating head for obtaining angular           \n      anisotropy measurements of the medium energy charged particles.         \n      A gear-drive motor steps through eight equal angular sectors            \n      per revolution for data collection. The cycle time for the              \n      rotation is 48 minutes or 25.6 minutes during cruise mode,              \n      and 192 second or 48 second during the planetary encounter.             \n                                                                              \n      The data were originally collected in the form of 'rates',              \n      which were not always converted into the usual physical                 \n      units. The reason is that such a conversion would depend on             \n      uncertain determinations such as the mass species of the                \n      particles and the level of background. Both mass species                \n      and background are generally determined from context during             \n      the study of particular regions. To convert 'rate' to                   \n      'intensity' for a particular channel one performs the                   \n      following tasks: 1) decide on the level of background                   \n      contamination and subtract that off the given rate level.               \n      Background is to be determined from context and from making             \n      use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 is covered by a 2 mm                    \n      Aluminium sunshield and used for data calibration).                     \n      2) Divide the background corrected rate by the channel                  \n      geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the channel.             \n      To determine the energy bandpass, one must judge the mass               \n      species of the detected particles (for ions but not for                 \n      electrons). The energy band passes are given in the form                \n      of 'energy/nucleon'. For channels that begin their names                \n      with the designations 'ch' these bandpasses can be used on              \n      mass species that are accepted into that channel, which                 \n      gives the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these               \n      entries are blank for electron channels). For other channels            \n      the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value                  \n      accepted. The bandpasses for other 'Z' values are not all               \n      known, but some are given in the literature (e.g.                       \n      [KRIMIGISETAL1979A]). The final product of these                        \n      instructions will be the particle intensity in the                      \n      unit of 'counts/(cm**2 sr sec keV)'.  LECP data can                     \n      also be in the form of flux, whose unit is                              \n      'cm**-1 sr**-1 sec**-1'.                                                \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n           Far Encounter Channel Definitions for Voyager 2 LECP               \n           CH  CH     LOW      HIGH    MEAN   GEOMETRIC    CH                 \n          Num NAME  (MeV/N)  (MeV/N)  (Mev/N)   FACTOR     LOGIC              \n                                             cm**2 sr  DEFINITIN              \n         --------------------------------------------------------             \n           1  EB01   0.013    0.035   0.020   0.00200                         \n           2  EBD1   0.013    0.035   0.020   0.00200                         \n           3  EB02   0.035    0.061   0.045   0.00200                         \n           4  EBD2   0.035    0.061   0.045   0.00200                         \n           5  EB03   0.061    0.112   0.090   0.00200                         \n           6  EBD3   0.061    0.112   0.090   0.00200                         \n           7  EB04   0.112    0.183   0.120   0.00200                         \n           8  EBD4   0.112    0.183   0.120   0.00200                         \n           9  EB05   0.183    0.500   0.200   0.00200                         \n           10 EBD5   0.183    0.500   0.200   0.00200                         \n           11 EG06   0.252    2.000   0.250   0.00200                         \n           12 EG07   0.480    2.000   0.500   0.00200                         \n           13 EG08   0.853    2.000   0.900   0.00200                         \n           14 EG09   2.100    5.000   2.000   0.00200                         \n           15  E44   0.350    1.500   0.500   1.31000                         \n           16  E45   2.000  100.000   2.000   1.31000                         \n           17  E37   6.000  100.000   6.000   1.31000                         \n           18 PL01   0.024    0.048   0.025   0.12000                         \n           19 PL02   0.048    0.080   0.050   0.12000                         \n           20 PL03   0.080    0.137   0.100   0.12000                         \n           21 PL04   0.137    0.215   0.150   0.12000                         \n           22 PL05   0.215    0.540   0.250   0.12000                         \n           23 PL06   0.540    0.990   0.600   0.12000                         \n           24 PL07   0.990    2.140   1.000   0.12000                         \n           25 PL08   2.140    3.500   2.500   0.12000                         \n           26  P32   0.330    0.610   0.350   0.09750  E0E2(E3)               \n           27   P1   0.520    1.450   0.600   0.44100  E1E2(E3)               \n           28  P10   4.400   11.400   5.000   0.53900  E2E3(E4)               \n           29  P11  11.400   20.000  12.000   0.53900  E2E3(E4)               \n           30  P16   3.040   17.000   5.000   1.50000  E5E4(E3)               \n           31  P23  22.000   30.000  25.000   1.31000  E5E4E3(E2)             \n           32  P27  37.000   89.000  50.000   1.20000  E5E4E3E2               \n           33  P31 213.000 1000.000 250.000   1.31000  E4E3           ",
