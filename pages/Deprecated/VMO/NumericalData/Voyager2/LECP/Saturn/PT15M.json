This instrument               \n      measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles (>26 keV          \n      electrons and >30 keV ions) with various levels of                      \n      discrimination based on energy, mass species, and angular               \n      arrival direction. A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are             \n      included with this data set. The LECP data are globally                 \n      calibrated to the extent possible (see below) and they are              \n      time averaged to about 15 minute time intervals with the exact          \n      beginning and ending times for those intervals matching the             \n      LECP instrumental cycle periods (the angular scanning periods).         \n      The LECP instrument has a rotating head for obtaining angular           \n      anisotropy measurements of the medium energy charged particles          \n      that it measures. The cycle time for the rotation is variable,          \n      but during encounters it is always faster than 15 minutes.              \n      Thus, the full angular anisotropy information is preserved with         \n      this data. The data is in the form of 'rate' data which has not         \n      been converted to the usual physical units. The reason is that          \n      such a conversion would depend on uncertain determinations such         \n      as the mass species of the particles and the level of                   \n      background. Both mass species and background are generally              \n      determined from context during the study of particular regions.         \n      To convert 'rate' to  'intensity' for a particular channel one          \n      performs the following tasks: 1) Decide on the level of                 \n      background contamination and subtract that off the given rate           \n      level. Background is to be determined from context and from             \n      making use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 has a 2 mm Al shield             \n      covering it). 2) Divide the background corrected rate by the            \n      channel geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the              \n      channel. The geometric factor is found in entry                         \n      'CHANNEL_GEOMETRIC_FACTOR' as associated with each channel              \n      'CHANNEL_ID'. To determine the energy bandpass, one must                \n      judge the mass species of the of the detected particles (for            \n      ions but not for electrons). The energy band passes are given           \n      in entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' and                           \n      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPENERGY', and             \n      are given in the form 'energy/nucleon'. For channels that               \n      begin their names with the designations 'CH' these bandpasses           \n      can be used on mass species that are accepted into that                 \n      channel (see entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' AND                 \n      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPCHANZ', which            \n      give the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these                \n      entries are blank for electron channels). For other channels            \n      the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value                  \n      accepted. The and passes for other 'Z' values are not all               \n      known, but some are given in the literature (e.g.                       \n      [KRIMIGISETAL1979A]). The final product of these instructions           \n      will be the particle intensity with the units:                          \n      counts/(cm^2 str sec keV).                                              \n                                                                              \n      Parameters                                                              \n      ==========                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Electron Rate                                                           \n      -------------                                                           \n      Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME                                   \n      Data Set Parameter Name        : ELECTRON RATE                          \n      Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 15.000000                              \n      Sampling Parameter Interval    : 15.000000                              \n      Data Set Parameter Unit        : COUNTS/SECOND                          \n      Noise Level                    : 0.000000                               \n      Sampling Parameter Unit        : MINUTE                                 \n                                                                              \n      A measured parameter equaling the number of electrons hitting           \n      a particle detector per specified accumulation interval.
