        "Description": "\n\n  Data Set Overview\n  =================\n\n    Data Set Description\n    --------------------\n      This near encounter data set consists of electron and ion\n      counting rate data from the Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP)\n      experiment on Voyager 1 while the spacecraft was within the\n      very close vicinity of Saturn. This instrument measures the\n      intensities of in-situ charged particles ( >13 keV electrons\n      and >24 keV ions) with various levels of discrimination based\n      on energy range and mass species. A subset of almost 100 LECP\n      channels are included in this data set. The LECP data are\n      globally calibrated to the extent possible.  During Saturn\n      near encounter, the LEMPA (Low Energy Magnetospheric Particle\n      Analyzer) subsystem was turned on for data collection.\n      Particles include low energy electrons, protons, alpha\n      particles, medium energy protons and ions, high energy and\n      intensity protons, electrons, alpha particles, and Z >= nuclei.\n      The near encounter data are 0.4 second rate measurements within\n      1/8 of the LECP instrumental motor rotation period (the\n      angular scanning periods, or step period).\n\n      The LECP instrument has a rotating head for obtaining angular\n      anisotropy measurements of the medium energy charged particles.\n      A gear-drive motor steps through eight equal angular sectors\n      per revolution for data collection. The cycle time for the\n      rotation is 48 minutes or 25.6 minutes during cruise mode,\n      and 192 second or 48 second during the planetary encounter.\n\n      The data were originally collected in the form of 'rates',\n      which were not always converted into the usual physical\n      units. The reason is that such a conversion would depend on\n      uncertain determinations such as the mass species of the\n      particles and the level of background. Both mass species\n      and background are generally determined from context during\n      the study of particular regions. To convert 'rate' to\n      'intensity' for a particular channel one performs the\n      following tasks: 1) decide on the level of background\n      contamination and subtract that off the given rate level.\n      Background is to be determined from context and from making\n      use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 is covered by a 2 mm\n      Aluminium sunshield and used for data calibration).\n      2) Divide the background corrected rate by the channel\n      geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the channel.\n      To determine the energy bandpass, one must judge the mass\n      species of the detected particles (for ions but not for\n      electrons). The energy band passes are given in the form\n      of 'energy/nucleon'. For channels that begin their names\n      with the designations 'ch' these bandpasses can be used on\n      mass species that are accepted into that channel, which\n      gives the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these\n      entries are blank for electron channels). For other channels\n      the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value\n      accepted. The bandpasses for other 'Z' values are not all\n      known, but some are given in the literature (e.g.\n      [KRIMIGISETAL1979A]). The final product of these\n      instructions will be the particle intensity in the\n      unit of 'counts/(cm**2 sr sec keV)'.  LECP data can\n      also be in the form of flux, whose unit is\n      'cm**-1 sr**-1 sec**-1'.\n\n           Near Encounter Channel Definitions for Voyager 2 LECP\n           CH  CH    LOW     HIGH    MEAN   GEOMETRIC    CH\n          Num NAME (MeV/N) (MeV/N) (Mev/N)   FACTOR     LOGIC\n                                             cm**2 sr  DEFINITIN\n         --------------------------------------------------------\n           1  EB01  0.013   0.035   0.020   0.00200\n           2  EBD1  0.013   0.035   0.020   0.00200\n           3  EB02  0.035   0.061   0.045   0.00200\n           4  EBD2  0.035   0.061   0.045   0.00200\n           5  EB03  0.061   0.112   0.090   0.00200\n           6  EBD3  0.061   0.112   0.090   0.00200\n           7  EB04  0.112   0.183   0.120   0.00200\n           8  EBD4  0.112   0.183   0.120   0.00200\n           9  EB05  0.183   0.500   0.200   0.00200\n          10  EBD5  0.183   0.500   0.200   0.00200\n          11  EG06  0.252   2.000   0.250   0.00200\n          12  EG07  0.480   2.000   0.500   0.00200\n          13  EG08  0.853   2.000   0.900   0.00200\n          14  EG09  2.100   5.000   2.000   0.00200\n          15  E44   0.350   1.500   0.500   1.31000\n          16  E45   2.000 100.000   2.000   1.31000\n          17  E37   6.000 100.000   6.000   1.31000\n          18  PL01  0.024   0.048   0.025   0.12000\n          19  PL02  0.048   0.080   0.050   0.12000\n          20  PL03  0.080   0.137   0.100   0.12000\n          21  PL04  0.137   0.215   0.150   0.12000\n          22  PL05  0.215   0.540   0.250   0.12000\n          23  PL06  0.540   0.990   0.600   0.12000\n          24  PL07  0.990   2.140   1.000   0.12000\n          25  PL08  2.140   3.500   2.500   0.12000\n          44  AL01  1.040   1.850   1.000   0.12000    CALC.\n          45  AL02  1.850   3.700   2.500   0.12000    CALC.\n          77  ESA0  2.500  99.999   2.500   0.49350    A-B COINC.\n          78  ESB0  8.500  99.999   8.500   0.94620    B 4 PI SR\n          79  AB10  8.500  99.999   8.500   0.05040    A-B COINC.\n          80  DP09  0.285   5.020   0.250   0.00084    DELTA'\n          81  DP10  0.480   2.580   0.600   0.00084    DELTA'\n          82  DP11  0.725   1.640   1.000   0.00084    DELTA'\n          83  PD09  0.285   5.250   0.250   0.00260    DELTA\n          84  PD10  0.480   2.720   0.600   0.00260    DELTA\n          85  PD11  0.725   1.580   1.000   0.00260    DELTA\n          86  AB12 54.000  87.300  50.000   0.05040    A-B COINC.\n          87  AB13 87.300 152.000 100.000   0.05040    A-B COINC.\n          88  PSA1 15.800 158.000  15.000   0.49350    A 2 PI SR\n          89  PSA2 15.800  49.000  25.000   0.49350    A 2 PI SR\n          90  PSA3 16.300  26.200  25.000   0.49350    A 2 PI SR\n          91  PSB1 54.000 174.000  50.000   0.94620    B 4 PI SR\n          92  PSB2 54.000  87.300  50.000   0.94620    B 4 PI SR\n          93  PSB3 54.000  59.000  50.000   0.94620    B 4 PI SR\n          94  DA03  0.480   2.450   0.600   0.00084    DELTA'\n          95  DA04  0.780   1.410   1.000   0.00084    DELTA'\n          96  DZ01  0.405  18.800   0.600   0.00084    DELTA'\n          97  AD03  0.480   2.580   0.600   0.00260    DELTA\n          98  AD04  0.780   1.480   1.000   0.00260    DELTA\n          99  ZD01  0.400  19.800   0.600   0.00260    DELTA\n         --------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n      Near encounter data are stored in files for channels from\n      different rate groups indicated by the file names, e.g.\n\n        V2YYDOY{A,B,...,H}NG0{1,2, ..., 9}.CSV\n        ------- ---------   --------------\n         | | |      |         |\n         | | |      |         rate group number\n         | | |      |\n         | | |      starting time A: 00:00:00\n         | | |                    B: 03:00:00\n         | | |                    C: 06:00:00\n         | | |                    D: 09:00:00\n         | | |                    E: 12:00:00\n         | | |                    F: 15:00:00\n         | | |                    G: 18:00:00\n         | | |                    H: 21:00:00\n         | | |\n         | |  3-digit day of year\n         | |\n         | 2-digit year\n         |\n         Voyager 2\n\n\n      Rate group definitions are listed as below:\n      -------------------------------------------------------\n       rate          channel names\n       group             in\n        #             the rate group\n      -------------------------------------------------------\n        1     PL01  PL02  PL03  EB04 EBP04\n        2     EB01 EBP01  EB02 EBP02  EB03 EBP03  EG06\n        3     PD09  DP09  PD10  DP10  PD11  DP11  AD03  DA03\n        4     EG07  EG08  EG09  EB05 EBP05\n        5 ",
