        "Description": "                                       \nThis data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy                     \nCharged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft               \nfor the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet              \nUranus.  The period covered is 1986/day 24/0000 SCET  to                     \n1986/day 27/0000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series                 \nof charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available            \nfrom the instrument.  The word approximates is used because                  \nthe angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the                   \nnature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,             \nand at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.                    \nWith the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged              \nfor those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are              \ntime averaged over an arbitrary period (24 seconds)                          \nfor the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle                 \naveraged records represent periods of time equal to 96 or 384                \nsec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called              \nthe LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is                   \nthe LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled                \nduring the scanning periods.                                                 \n                                                                             \n   Two scanning situations occurred during the time of this                  \ndata. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for                \neach of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;               \nnote that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), and 2) a special               \nUranus scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, scan,               \n7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 represents a 10.4 minute                  \nperiod when the instrument is fixed in sector 7, and where the               \nword scan represents a period of scanning (6 sec stepping                    \nfor a total scan time of 48 sec).  For this Uranus Scan data                 \nthe two adjacent scans within the Uranus scan cyclic have been               \naveraged together into a single, 96 sec record. The records                  \nof the 48 sec stepping mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 minutes.              \nAs stated in the first paragraph, the records for the periods                \nof no stepping during the Uranus scan cyclic (mode 2 above)                  \nare for 24 sec periods.                                                      \n                                                                             \n     The schedule of mode changes is as follows:                             \n                                                                             \n     prior to day 24/0420:      Mode (1)                                     \n                                                                             \n     24/0420  to  25/ 1357:     Mode (2)                                     \n                                                                             \n     after day 25/1357:         Mode (1)                                     \n                                                                             \nPlease note that the change-over between modes is not                        \ninstantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the                   \nscanning is not regular.  Not also that there were brief                     \ninterruptions to, and changes in time phase in, the Mode (2)                 \nscan cyclic during the transitions into and out of the                       \nmovable block periods that bracketed the close approach                      \nposition (not shown above).                                                  \n                                                                             \n     Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample             \nswitching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data               \na disjointed appearance.                                                     \n                                                                             \n     The LECP channels utilized with this data set are:                      \n                                                                             \n       EB01:          electrons,  22 to  35  keV                             \n       EB02:          electrons,  35 to  61  keV                             \n       EB03:          electrons,  61 to  112 keV                             \n       EB04:          electrons, 112 to 183  keV                             \n       EG06-EG07:     electrons, 252 to 480  keV                             \n       EG07-EG08:     electrons, 480 to 853  keV                             \n       EG08-EG09:     electrons, 853 to 1200 keV                             \n       PL01:          ions,       28 to  43  keV                             \n       PL02:          ions,       43 to  80  keV                             \n       PL03:          ions,       80 to 137  keV                             \n       PL04:          ions,      137 to 215  keV                             \n       PL05:          ions,      215 to 540  keV                             \n       PL06:          ions,      540 to 990  keV                             \n       PL07:          ions,      990 to 2140 keV                             \n       PL08:          ions,     2140 to 3500 keV                             \n                                                                             \nPlease note that 3 of the electron channels are derived from                 \n4 of the instrumental channels by taking differences between                 \nadjacent (in energy) channels.                                               \n                                                                             \n     The channel data is given in units of intensity:                        \ncounts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed                \nthat they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from                \nthe raw count rates via the relation:                                        \n                                                                             \n                    I  =  CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                    \n                                                                             \nwhere eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and                  \n(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton               \nvalues of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities             \nfor this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption           \nthat some other mass species dominates, one must convert back                \nto count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then                 \nconvert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the               \nmass species in question.  The parameters can be found in                    \nTable 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                 \nV. 86, page 8227, 1981).  The corresponding parameters for electrons         \ncan be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                \nV. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,             \nthe count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,                     \n(2) electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and             \n(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.                 \n                                                                             \n     The uncertainty parameters given with the data associated with          \neach channel (expressed as a percent) is the largest of the                  \ntwo quantities",
