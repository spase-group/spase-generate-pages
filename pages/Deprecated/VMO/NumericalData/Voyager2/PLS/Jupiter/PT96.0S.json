This data set was given a new DATA_SET_ID       \n      and intentionally marked as V1.0.                                       \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Data Set Description                                                    \n      --------------------                                                    \n      This data set contains the best estimates of the total ion              \n      density from Voyager 2 at Jupiter in the PLS voltage range              \n      (10-5950 eV/Q). It is calculated using the method of                    \n      [MCNUTTETAL1981] which to first order consists of taking the            \n      total measured current and dividing by the collector area and           \n      plasma bulk velocity. This method is only accurate for high             \n      mach number flows directly into the detector, and may result            \n      in underestimates of the total density of a factor of 2 in the          \n      outer magnetosphere. Thus absolute densities should be treated          \n      with caution, but density variations in the data set can be             \n      trusted. The low resolution mode density is used at all times           \n      except day 190 2100-2200 when the larger of the high and low            \n      resolution mode densities in a 96 sec period is used.                   \n      Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a constant velocity            \n      component of 200 km/s into the D cup is used outside of this.           \n      These are the densities given in the [MCNUTTETAL1981] paper             \n      corrected by a factor of 1.209 (.9617) for densities obtained           \n      from the side (main) sensor. This correction is due to a                \n      better calculation of the effective area of the sensors. Data           \n      format: column 1 is time (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2           \n      is the moment density in cm^-3. Each row has format (a24, 1x,           \n      1pe9.2). Values of -9.99e+10 indicate that the parameter could          \n      not be obtained from the data using the standard analysis               \n      technique.

Discrimination with regard to mass and or               \n      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,             \n      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument               \n      limitations.                                                            \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               \n      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or           \n      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                   \n      moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will be          \n      provided in a single data set. In general, if more than one             \n      ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total               \n      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                    \n      densities. If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian             \n      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as the          \n      sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of each           \n      Maxwellian is given.                                                    \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Source Instrument Parameters                                            \n      ============================                                            \n      Instrument Host ID              : VG2                                   \n      Data Set Parameter Name         : ION DENSITY                           \n      Instrument Parameter Name       : ION RATE                              \n                                        ION CURRENT                           \n                                        PARTICLE MULTIPLE PARAMETERS          \n      Important Instrument Parameters : 1 (for all parameters)                \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Processing                                                              \n      ==========                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Processing History                                                      \n      ------------------                                              ",
