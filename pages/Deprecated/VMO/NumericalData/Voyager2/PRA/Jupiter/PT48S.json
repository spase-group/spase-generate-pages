Data             \n      are provided for 70 instrument channels covering the range              \n      from 1.2 kHz to 1326 kHz in uniform 19.2 kHz steps, each 1 kHz          \n      wide. Data are included for the period 1979-04-25 00:00:00.000          \n      through 1979-08-04 23:04:00.000. In order to produce this data          \n      set from the original raw PRA data, several steps have been             \n      taken:                                                                  \n                                                                              \n      1. The PRA operates in a variety of modes; data from modes in           \n      which the receiver does not scan rapidly through its frequency          \n      range have been removed;                                                \n      2. The data have been calibrated as best we know how;                   \n      3. The data have been split into Left Hand Circular (LHC) and           \n      Right Hand Circular (RHC) components;                                   \n      4. The data have been binned into 48-second intervals.                  \n                                                                              \n      Thus, values at a given channel are separated in time by an             \n      increment of 48 seconds; each 48-second time interval has               \n      associated with it a value for LHC polarization and one for             \n      RHC polarization.                                                       \n                                                                              \n      During data gaps, the entire record is absent from the                  \n      data set; that is, missing records have not been zero-filled            \n      or otherwise marked. Bad data within a record is indicated by           \n      the value zero, which cannot otherwise occur.                           \n                                                                              \n      Each datum is returned as a 16-bit quantity; it represents the          \n      mean power received in the given channel at the specified time          \n      and polarization. The returned quantity is the value in mB              \n      about a reference flux density. To convert a returned quantity          \n      to flux, use the formula:                                               \n                                                                              \n      flux   = 7.0x10^(-22)x10^(mB/1000) W m-2 Hz-1                           \n                                                                              \n      Parameters                                                              \n      ==========                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Data Set Parameter 'RADIO WAVE SPECTRUM'                                \n      ----------------------------------------                                \n      Data Set Parameter Name        : RADIO WAVE SPECTRUM                    \n      Data Set Parameter Unit        : MILLIBEL                               \n      Sampling Parameter Name        : TIME                                   \n      Sampling Parameter Unit        : SECOND                                 \n      Sampling Parameter Resolution  : 0.001                                  \n      Sampling Parameter Interval    : 48                                     \n      Minimum Available Sampling Int : 12                                     \n      Noise Level                    : 2400                                   \n                                                                              \n      A set of derived parameters consisting of power fluxes at               \n      various contiguous frequencies over a range of frequencies.             \n      Millibels may be converted to watts/m**2/Hz by using the                \n      formula for flux indicated above.                                       \n                                                                              \n      Source Instrument Parameters                                            \n      ============================                                            \n      Instrument Host ID              : VG2                                   \n      Data Set Parameter Name         : RADIO WAVE SPECTRUM                   \n      Instrument Parameter Name       : WAVE FLUX DENSITY                     \n                                        ELECTRIC FIELD WAVEFORM               \n                                        ELECTRIC FIELD COMPONENT              \n                                        MAGNETIC FIELD COMPONENT              \n                                        WAVE ELECTRIC FIELD INTENSITY         \n                                        WAVE MAGNETIC FIELD INTENSITY         \n      Important Instrument Parameters : 1 (for all parameters)                \n                                                                              \n      Data Coverage                                                           \n      =============                                                           \nFilename   Records               Start                 Stop                   \n-------------------------------------------------------------------           \nVolume ID: VG_1502                                                            \nPRA.DAT  128633   1979-04-25T00:00:00.000Z  1979-08-04T23:04:00.000Z",
