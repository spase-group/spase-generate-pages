        "Description": "                                       \nThis dataset consists of edited browse data derived from an                  \noriginal dataset obtained from the Voyager 2 Planetary Radio                 \nAstronomy (PRA) instrument in the                                            \nvicinity of Uranus. Data are provided for 70 instrument                      \nchannels covering the range from 1.2 kHz to 1326 kHz in                      \nuniform 19.2 kHz steps, each 1 kHz wide. Data are included                   \nfor the period 1986:019:00:00 through 1986:031:23:59. In order               \nto produce this dataset from the original raw PRA data,                      \nseveral steps have been taken:                                               \n                                                                             \n1. The PRA operates in a variety of modes; data from modes                   \nin which the receiver does not scan rapidly through its                      \nfrequency range have been removed;                                           \n2. The data have been calibrated as best we know how;                        \n3. The data have been split into Left Hand Circular (LHC)                    \n   and Right Hand Circular (RHC) components;                                 \n4. The data have been binned into 48-second intervals.                       \n                                                                             \nThus, values at a given channel are separated in time by an                  \nincrement of 48 seconds; each 48-second time interval has                    \nassociated with it a value for LHC polarization and one for                  \nRHC polarization.                                                            \n                                                                             \nDuring data gaps, the entire record is absent from the                       \ndataset; that is, missing records have not been zero-filled                  \nor otherwise marked. Bad data within a record is indicated                   \nby the value zero, which cannot otherwise occur.                             \n                                                                             \nEach datum is returned as a 16-bit quantity; it represents                   \nthe mean power received in the given channel at the                          \nspecified time and polarization. The returned quantity is                    \nthe value in milliBels (mB) about a reference flux density. The value of     \n0 mB represents a voltage of 1 microvolt across the front                    \nend of the receiver.  To convert a returned quantity to flux,                \nuse the formula:                                                             \n                                                                             \n        flux   = 7.0x10^(-22)x10^(Mb/1000) W m-2 Hz-1",
