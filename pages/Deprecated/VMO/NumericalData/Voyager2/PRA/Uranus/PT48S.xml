This dataset consists of edited browse data derived from an                  
original dataset obtained from the Voyager 2 Planetary Radio                 
Astronomy (PRA) instrument in the                                            
vicinity of Uranus. Data are provided for 70 instrument                      
channels covering the range from 1.2 kHz to 1326 kHz in                      
uniform 19.2 kHz steps, each 1 kHz wide. Data are included                   
for the period 1986:019:00:00 through 1986:031:23:59. In order               
to produce this dataset from the original raw PRA data,                      
several steps have been taken:                                               
                                                                             
1. The PRA operates in a variety of modes; data from modes                   
in which the receiver does not scan rapidly through its                      
frequency range have been removed;                                           
2. The data have been calibrated as best we know how;                        
3. The data have been split into Left Hand Circular (LHC)                    
   and Right Hand Circular (RHC) components;                                 
4. The data have been binned into 48-second intervals.                       
                                                                             
Thus, values at a given channel are separated in time by an                  
increment of 48 seconds; each 48-second time interval has                    
associated with it a value for LHC polarization and one for                  
RHC polarization.                                                            
                                                                             
During data gaps, the entire record is absent from the                       
dataset; that is, missing records have not been zero-filled                  
or otherwise marked. Bad data within a record is indicated                   
by the value zero, which cannot otherwise occur.                             
                                                                             
Each datum is returned as a 16-bit quantity; it represents                   
the mean power received in the given channel at the                          
specified time and polarization. The returned quantity is                    
the value in milliBels (mB) about a reference flux density. The value of     
0 mB represents a voltage of 1 microvolt across the front                    
end of the receiver.  To convert a returned quantity to flux,                
use the formula:                                                             
                                                                             
        flux   = 7.0x10^(-22)x10^(Mb/1000) W m-2 Hz-1</Description>
