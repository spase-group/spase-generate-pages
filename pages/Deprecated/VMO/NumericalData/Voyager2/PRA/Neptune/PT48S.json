The PRA operates in a variety of modes; data from modes                \n       in which the receiver does not scan rapidly through its                \n       frequency range have been removed;                                     \n    2. The data have been calibrated as best we know how;                     \n    3. The data have been split into Left Hand Circular (LHC)                 \n       and Right Hand Circular (RHC) components;                              \n    4. The data have been binned into 48-second intervals.                    \n                                                                              \n    Thus, values at a given channel are separated in time by an               \n    increment of 48 seconds; each 48-second time interval has                 \n    associated with it a value for LHC polarization and one for               \n    RHC polarization.                                                         \n                                                                              \n    During data gaps, the entire record is absent from the                    \n    dataset; that is, missing records have not been zero-filled               \n    or otherwise marked. Bad data within a record is indicated                \n    by the value zero, which cannot otherwise occur.                          \n                                                                              \n    Each datum is returned as a 16-bit quantity; it represents                \n    the mean power received in the given channel at the                       \n    specified time and polarization. The returned quantity is                 \n    the value in mB about a reference flux density. The value of              \n    0 mB represents a voltage of 1 microvolt across the front                 \n    end of the receiver.  To convert a returned quantity to flux,             \n    use the formula:                                                          \n                                                                              \n            flux   = 7.0x10^(-22)x10^(mB/1000) W m-2 Hz-1 ",
