Since the PRA instrument is able to            \nobserve planetary phenomenon at much larger ranges than other fields          \nand particles experiments, thus the PRA data cover a variable and             \nlonger encounter period. PRA lowband data provided here cover the             \nentire Neptune Encounter Phase (1989-05-25 to 1989-09-27).                    \n                                                                              \nEach file within the dataset represents a single PRA high rate frame,         \nof duration 48 seconds. Each file contains a 28 octet header, followed        \nby 1280000 octets of data.                                                    \n                                                                              \nThe header format is described as below:                                      \n--------------------------------------------------------------------          \nLength (bytes) Name            Contents                                       \n--------------------------------------------------------------------          \n2              Year            Year A.D.                                      \n2              Day             Day of year (1 Jan == 1)                       \n1              Hour            Hour of day (midnight == 0)                    \n1              Minute          Minute of hour (o'clock = 0)                   \n1              Second          Second of Minute                               \n                                 (exact minute == 0)                          \n1              Spacecraft      1 == V1, 2 == V2                               \n2              Integral FDS    Integer part of FDS count                      \n1              Fractional FDS  Fractional part of FDS count                   \n4              Freq. 1         Frequency of 1st channel (Hz)                  \n4              Freq. 2         Frequency of 2nd channel (Hz)                  \n4              Freq. 3         Frequency of 3rd channel (Hz)                  \n4              Freq. 4         Frequency of 4th channel (Hz)                  \n1              Bandwidth       Bandwidth (kHz)                                \n--------------------------------------------------------------------          \nwhere all values are unsigned, and multi-octet values are presented           \nwith the most significant byte first.                                         \n                                                                              \nThe data are 16 bit numbers, most significant byte first, with 0              \nindicating unavailable data. The data are presented as a single               \nstream of 16 bit numbers. The frame is logically divided into lines           \n(although there is no indication of the lines within the file). This          \nterminology comes from the fact that in this high rate mode, the PRA          \ndata are treated exactly as if they were imaging data, and a 48 second        \nimage comprises 800 horizontal scan lines. Similarly, there are 800           \nlogical lines within a PRA frame. Each line comprises 800 values,             \nrepresenting 400 data pairs. In the high rate mode, the PRA measures          \nthe flux at two frequencies _simultaneously_ and returns these two data       \nsequentially. A sample pair is acquired every (actually every 138.88...       \nmicroseconds), through an RC filter with a 100 microsecond time constant.     \nA single line comprises 60 milliseconds of data. Lines are NOT contiguous     \nin time. There is a 4444.44... microsecond gap between the ending of one      \nline and the start of the succeeding line.                                    \n                                                                              \nThe PRA samples a frequency pair in this manner for 24 seconds. It then       \nhas the option of switching to a second pair for the final 24 seconds.        \nThese frequencies are designated Freq. 1 through Freq. 4 in the header.       \nThe data are presented such that the higher of the relevant frequency         \npair is presented first.",
