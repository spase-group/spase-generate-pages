        "Description": "The Schonstedt triaxial magnetometer, located at a few meters away from the spacecraft was designed to provide the orthogonal components of the magnetic field: Hp was parallel to the spin axis that was held nearly in the direction of Earth's axis, He was directed toward Earth center, and Hn pointed eastward. The magnetometer had a range of +/- 1000 nT (without saturation) and a resolution of 0.1 nT. After temperature correction, and before (undescribed) stray-field correction, the accuracy is at about 1 nT level. Data files contain long descriptive header.",
