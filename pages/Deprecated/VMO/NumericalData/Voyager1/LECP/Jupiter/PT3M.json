Data records from the version 1.0 data set provided           \n      data for each of 8 sectors, plus the average for all sectors            \n      in a separate record for each channel.  This resulted in 9              \n      repeated times per channel.  Data records for the version 1.1           \n      data set provide all data for a given channel and time period           \n      (8 sectors, plus the average for all sectors) in a single               \n      record.  Other changes to this version include upgrading of             \n      the associated labels and templates to PDS version 3.2                  \n      compliance, modification of the time formats and flag values.           \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n    Data Set Description                                                      \n    --------------------                                                      \n      This data set consists of resampled data from the Low Energy            \n      Charged Particle (LECP) experiment on Voyager 1 while the               \n      spacecraft was in the vicinity of Jupiter.  This instrument             \n      measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles (>26 keV          \n      electrons and >30 keV ions) with various levels of                      \n      discrimination based on energy, mass species, and angular               \n      arrival direction.  A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are            \n      included with this data set.  The LECP data are globally                \n      calibrated to the extent possible (see below) and they are time         \n      averaged to about 15 minute time intervals with the exact               \n      beginning and ending times for those intervals matching the             \n      LECP instrumental cycle periods (the angular scanning periods).         \n      The LECP instrument has a rotating head for obtaining angular           \n      anisotropy measurements of the medium energy charged particles          \n      that it measures.  The cycle time for the rotation is variable,         \n      but during encounters it is always faster than 15 minutes.              \n      Thus, the full angular anisotropy information is preserved with         \n      this data.  The data is in the form of 'rate' data which has            \n      not been converted to the usual physical units.  The reason is          \n      that such a conversion would depend on uncertain determinations         \n      such as the mass species of the particles and the level of              \n      background.  Both mass species and background are generally             \n      determined from context during the study of particular regions.         \n      To convert 'rate' to 'intensity' for a particular channel one           \n      performs the following tasks: 1) Decide on the level of                 \n      background contamination and subtract that off the given rate           \n      level.  Background is to be determined from context and from            \n      making use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 has a 2 mm Al shield             \n      covering it).  2) Divide the background corrected rate by the           \n      channel geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the              \n      channel.  The geometric factor is found in entry                        \n      'CHANNEL_GEOMETRIC_FACTOR' as associated with each channel              \n      'CHANNEL_ID'.  To determine the energy bandpass, one must judge         \n      the mass species of the of the detected particles (for ions but         \n      not for electrons).  The energy band passes are given in                \n      entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' and                              \n      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPENERGY', and are         \n      given in the form 'energy/nucleon'.  For channels that begin            \n      their names with the designations 'CH' these bandpasses can be          \n      used on mass species that are accepted into that channel (see           \n      entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' AND                              \n      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPCHANZ', which            \n      give the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these                \n      entries are blank for electron channels).  For other channels           \n      the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value                  \n      accepted.  The and passes for other 'Z' values are not all              \n      known, but some are given in the literature (e.g.                       \n      [KRIMIGISETAL1979A]).  The final product of these instructions          \n      will be the particle intensity with the units: counts/(cm^2 str         \n      sec keV).                                                               \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \nThis figure represents the structure of a single data record.
