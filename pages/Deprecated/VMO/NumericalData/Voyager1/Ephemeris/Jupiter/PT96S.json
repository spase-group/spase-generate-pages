Version 1.1          \n      includes additional columns not present in the previous                \n      version, 96 second rather than 48 second time samples, times           \n      converted to 'PDS Style' or ISO standard, and upgrading of             \n      PDS labels and templates to version 3.2.  The SPICE based              \n      data that are also part of this data set were not previously           \n      archived with the PDS.  This version 1.1 data set replaces             \n      previously archived versions.                                          \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n    Data Set Description                                                     \n    --------------------                                                     \n      This data set consists of Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter                  \n      ephemeris data in System III (1965) left handed coordinates            \n      covering the period 1979-03-03 to 1979-03-16.  Two versions,           \n      both covering the same time period, but containing slightly            \n      different data, are provided.  One version was generated by            \n      the Voyager MAG team from Voyager 1 SEDR, the other by the             \n      PDS/PPI node using the VG1_JUP.BSP and PCK00003.TCP SPICE              \n      kernels.                                                               \n                                                                             \n      Two versions of the spacecraft ephemeris data are provided as          \n      an attempt to correct some of the problems in the Voyager              \n      SEDR while preserving the ability to reproduce early results.          \n      The original SEDR data has a variety of problems which may             \n      affect the knowledge of the spacecraft position, or                    \n      conversely, the timing associated with certain events such as          \n      ring plane crossings.  The SPICE SPK kernel provided on this           \n      disk includes corrections to some, but not all, of the                 \n      problems associated with the Voyager SEDR.  The Navigation             \n      and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL may issue a           \n      new Voyager SPK kernel in the future that will further                 \n      improve the knowledge of the spacecraft location in inertial           \n      space.                                                                 \n                                                                             \n      There are other differences in the in the two versions of              \n      ephemeris data that are the result of improvements in the              \n      knowledge of some of the physical constants associated with            \n      Jupiter and its moons.  Since the Voyager era, there have              \n      been updates to the orientation of the jovian spin axis right          \n      ascension and declination, the radius of Jupiter, as well as           \n      the orbital characteristic and other physical parameters of            \n      many of the moons of Jupiter.  These changes affect the                \n      stated position of the spacecraft in jovigraphic coordinate            \n      systems like System III without changing the position of the           \n      spacecraft in inertial space.  The spin rate of Jupiter is             \n      not changed from the System III (1965) rate of 9h 55m                  \n      29.71sec (870.536 deg/day).  The SPICE planetary constants             \n      kernel (PCK) contains both the current IAU definitions of the          \n      physical constants for the bodies within in the jovian system          \n      (as data) as well as the older IAU definitions (as comments).          \n      This is an ASCII text file (PCK00003.TCP) and users of the             \n      ephemeris data are encouraged to review it.                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n    SEDR generated ephemeris                                                 \n    ------------------------                                                 \n      Instrument P.I.       : N/A                                            \n      Data Supplier         : NSSDC (Voyager MAG Team)                       \n      Data sampling rate    : 96 seconds                                     \n      Data Set Start Time   : 1979-03-03T00:00:35.978Z                       \n      Data Set Stop Time    : 1979-03-16T23:59:08.185Z                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n    SPICE generated ephemeris                                                \n    -------------------------                                                \n      Instrument P.I.       : N/A                                            \n      Data Supplier         : S.
