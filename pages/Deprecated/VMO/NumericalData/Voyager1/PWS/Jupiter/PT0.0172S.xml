  Data Set Overview                                                           
  =================                                                           
    This data set consists of electric field spectrum analyzer data           
    from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Subsystem obtained during the              
    entire mission.  Data after 2013-12-31 will be added to the archive
    on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum             
    analyzer observations obtained in the cruise mission phases               
    before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases        
    as well as those obtained during the two encounter phases.                
                                                                              
    The Voyager 1 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 100 AU over         
    the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when            
    some key events occurred during the mission, the following table          
    is provided.

  Data Sampling                                                               
  =============                                                               
    This data set consists of full resolution edited, wave electric           
    field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum        
    analyzer obtained during the entire mission.  For each time               
    interval, a field strength is determined for each of the 16               
    spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10         
    Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in           
    frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated with            
    each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning        
    of the scan.  The time between spectra in this data set vary by           
    telemetry mode and range from 4 seconds to 96 seconds.  During            
    data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries exist in         
    the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any          
    other way.  When one or more channels are missing within a scan,          
    the missing measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not        
    calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in          
    raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they          
    are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field                 
    strength.  Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use         
    with this data set; the use of these is described below.                  
                                                                              
    For the cruise data sets, the timing of samples is dependent upon         
    the spacecraft telemetry mode.  In principle, one can determine           
    the temporal resolution between spectra simply by noting the              
    difference in time between two records in the files.  In some             
    studies, more precise timing information is necessary.  Here, we          
    describe the timing of the samples for the PWS low rate data as a         
    function of telemetry mode.                                               
                                                                              
    The PWS instrument uses two logarithmic compressors as detectors          
    for the 16-channel spectrum analyzer, one for the bottom (lower           
    frequency) 8 channels, and one for the upper (higher frequency) 8         
    channels.  For each bank of 8 channels, the compressor                    
    sequentially steps from the lowest frequency of the 8 to the              
    highest in a regular time step to obtain a complete spectrum.  At         
    each time step, the higher frequency channel is sampled 1/8 s             
    prior to the lower frequency channel so that the channels are             
    sampled in the following order with channel 1 being the lowest            
    frequency channel (10 Hz) and 16 being the highest (56.2 kHz): 9,         
    1, 10, 2, 11, 3, ...  15, 7, 16, 8.  The primary difference               
    between the various data modes is the stepping rate from one              
    channel to the next (ranging from 0.5 to 12 s, corresponding to           
    temporal resolutions between complete spectra of 4 s to 96 s).            
                                                                              
    In the following table, we present the hexadecimal id for the             
    various telemetry modes, the mode mnemonic ID, the time between           
    frequency steps, and the time between complete spectra.  We also          
    provide the offset from the beginning of the instrument cycle (one        
    complete spectrum) identified as the time of each record&apos;s time           
    tag to the time of the sampling for the first high-frequency              
    channel (channel 9) and for the first low-frequency channel               
    (channel 1).                                                              
                                                                              
                                    Time
