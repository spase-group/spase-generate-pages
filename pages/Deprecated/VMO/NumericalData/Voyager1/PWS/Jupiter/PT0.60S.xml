  Data Set Overview                                                          
  =================                                                          
    This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from           
    the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Subsystem waveform receiver obtained           
    during the entire mission.  Data after 2013-11-02 will be added to the   
    archive on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all             
    waveform observations obtained in the cruise mission phases              
    before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter              
    phases as well as those obtained during the two encounter                
    phases.                                                                  
                                                                             
    The Voyager 1 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 100 AU over        
    the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when           
    some key events occurred during the mission, the following table         
    is provided.

  Data Sampling                                                              
  =============                                                              
    The waveform is sampled at 4-bit resolution through a bandpass           
    filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  1600 samples are             
    collected in 55.56 msec (at a rate of 28,800 samples per second)         
    followed by a 4.44-msec gap.  Each 60-msec interval constitutes          
    a line of waveform samples.  The data set includes frames of             
    waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, or 48 seconds,           
    each.  The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical           
    to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as                   
    constructs in describing the form of the data.                           
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Data Processing                                                            
  ===============                                                            
    Because there is no direct method for calibrating these data and         
    because the raw format of packed, 4-bit samples is                       
    space-efficient, these data are not processed for archiving.             
    The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform;         
    this is useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the           
    spacecraft.  But the normal method of analyzing the waveform             
    data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to            
    arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.  By stacking           
    the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-time                 
    spectrogram can be produced.                                             
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Data                                                                       
  ====                                                                       
    The waveforms are collections of samples of the electric field           
    measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800              
    samples per second.  The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital           
    values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but          
    the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain           
    control used in the waveform receiver.  The instantaneous                
    dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 dB, but          
    the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the             
    passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the                
    instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain control, the overall         
    dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 dB.  The             
    automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the               
    ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data.            
    However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier           
    transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the                
    spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained          
    in most cases.

    The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole          
    pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.         
    However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured              
    field to any particular direction such as the local magnetic             
    field or direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft          
    remains in a 3-axis stabilized orientation almost continuously,          
    and these </Description>
