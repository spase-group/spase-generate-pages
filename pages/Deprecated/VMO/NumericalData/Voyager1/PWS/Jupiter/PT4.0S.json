Changes to this version include the upgrade of          \n      the associated labels and templates to PDS version 3                   \n      compliance.                                                            \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n    Data Set Description                                                     \n    --------------------                                                     \n      This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric               \n      field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver              \n      spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Jovian               \n      magnetosphere.  For each 4-second interval, a field strength           \n      is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels            \n      whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2                   \n      kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in frequency,           \n      four channels per decade.  The time associated with each set           \n      of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning of           \n      the scan.  During data gaps where complete 4-second spectra            \n      are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps           \n      are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  When one or           \n      more channels are missing within a scan, the missing                   \n      measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not                 \n      calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted          \n      in raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis               \n      since they are roughly proportional to the log of the                  \n      electric field strength.  Calibration procedures and tables            \n      are provided for use with this data set; the use of these is           \n      described below.                                                       \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n    Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                    \n    -------------------------------------                                    \n      The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text            \n      file named VG1PWSCL.TAB (for Voyager-1).  This provides                \n      information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output           \n      of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna          \n      voltages for each frequency channel.  Following is a brief             \n      description of these files and a tutorial in their                     \n      application.                                                           \n                                                                             \n      Descriptive headers have been removed from this file.  The             \n      columns included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02, ICHAN03, ICHAN04,          \n      ICHAN05, ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.                                         \n                                                                             \n      The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed            \n      by the corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of             \n      the 16 frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each          \n      line contains calibrations for successive data number values           \n      ranging from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually                   \n      represents the lack of data since the baseline noise values            \n      for each channel are all above that.)                                  \n                                                                             \n      A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a          \n      data structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to             \n      obtain the appropriate voltage for a given data number and             \n      frequency channel.
