      Data Set Overview                                                       
      =================                                                       
      This data set (VG1-S-PRA-3-RDR-LOWBAND-6SEC-V1.0) contains data         
      acquired by the Voyager-1 Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) instrument    
      during the Saturn encounter.  Since the PRA instrument is able to       
      observe planetary phenomenon at much larger ranges than other fields    
      and particles experiments, thus the PRA data cover a variable and       
      longer encounter period. PRA lowband data provided here cover the       
      entire Saturn Encounter Phase (1981-06-05 to 1981-09-28).               
                                                                              
      VG1-S-PRA-3-RDR-LOWBAND-6SEC-V1.0 contains data at the highest          
      time resolution possible during normal operations. The normal           
      mode of PRA operations during the planetary encounters was to           
      sweep through the two radio receiver bands, high band (40.5 to          
      1.5 MHz in 128 channels spaced 0.3072 MHz apart) and low band           
      (1326.0 to 1.2 kHz in 70 channels spaced 19.2 kHz apart) in a           
      period of 6 seconds. The receivers measured, on alternate               
      samples, the left hand circular and right hand circular (radio          
      definition) power.                                                      
                                                                              
      Measured Parameters                                                     
      ===================                                                     
      The data here are from the low frequency receiver band and are          
      &apos;packaged&apos; into spacecraft major frame records. Each major              
      frame is 48 seconds long or eight sweeps through the PRA                
      receiver. The data are calibrated and are given in units of             
      &apos;millibels&apos; which is 1000 times the log of the received power.          
      Zero millbels corresponds to approximately 1.4 x 10^-21 W m^-2          
      Hz^-1, however, this value is never seen in practice. The               
      minimum values detected, which includes receiver internal and           
      spacecraft generated noise, are about 2300 to 2400 millibels,           
      or about 3.5 x 10^-19 W m^-2 Hz^-1; even higher values are seen         
      at the very lowest frequencies.                                         
                                                                              
      The data format is ASCII and consists of a time indicator               
      followed by an array containing the eight low band sweeps.              
      Time is spacecraft event time (SCET) which is basically                 
      universal time at the spacecraft. Specifically, time is in the          
      form of YYMMDD and seconds into YYMMDD. Both are written as             
      I6. Example: July 1, 1979 at 12 hours SCET would be 790701,             
      43200. The seconds corresponds, to the nearest second, to the           
      start of the sweep (which occurs in PRA high band). The first           
      value in low band (1326.0 kHz) occurs some 3.9 seconds after            
      this time and samples at successively lower frequencies are             
      space 0.03 seconds apart. Only one time is given for the                
      entire major frame, thus the start of each sweep is the time            
      given plus 6 times the sweep number minus 1 (i.e., 0 through            
      7).                                                                     
                                                                              
      The data array is dimensioned as 71 X 8 and written as I4               
      format (i.e. 568I4). The &apos;8&apos; corresponds to the eight PRA               
      sweeps. The lowest 68 of the 70 low band channels (1287.6               
      to 1.2 kHz) are in positions 2-69.  Positions 70-71 should be           
      ignored. Missing or bad data values are set to zero. In                 
      position 1 of each sweep is a status word where the 12 least            
      significant bits have used, although not all 12 have meaning            
      for PRA low band. Numbering those bits 0 for least significant          
      to 11 for most significant, the bits that have meaning are as           
      follows:                                                                
      bit                                                                     
         0: 15 dB attenuator in use when equal to 1                           
         1: 30 dB attenuator in use when equal to 1                           
         2: 45 dB attenuator in use when equal to 1                           
         9,10 (together): polarization of first channel sampled               
                          (1326.0 kHz) according to the scheme:               
                         value bit 10 =                                       
                                 0 1                                          
                value bit 9 = 0  R L                                          
                              1  L R                                          
                                                                              
      Polarization at successively lower frequencies is opposite to           
      the frequency above it, i.e. either a LRLR or an RLRL pattern.          
      Successive 6-second sweeps start on the opposite polarization           
      as the previous sweep as indicated in the status bits. Note             
      that this polarization is the received polarization, not                
      necessarily the emitted polarization. Correct interpretation            
      of the received polarization depends on the antenna plane               
      orientation relative to the radio source. A good description            
      of this concept can be found in [LEBLANCETAL1987].                      
                                                                              
      Missing or bad data values are set to zero. If the status word          
      is zero, any data in that receiver sweep should be discarded.</Description>
