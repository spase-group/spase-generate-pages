The original data sets contain a mix of engineering, \n      electron, magnetic field and plasma data.  The Voyager magnetometer     \n      (MAG) experiment now resides on a dedicated workstation where only MAG  \n      data are processed.                                                     \n                                                                              \n      All Voyager MAG data submitted to the NSSDC consists wholly of high     \n      resolution LFM averages.  These files consist of a set of averages      \n      applied across all of the mission's differing telemetry modes.  In the  \n      case of the Magnetometer Experiment, the records contain both           \n      1.92 second, 9.6 second and 48 second averages.  1.92 second averages   \n      are created from the detail detail data, 9.6 second averages are created\n      from 1.92 second averages and 48 second averages are created from the   \n      9.6 second averages.                                                    \n                                                                              \n      All data in this NSSDC data set are interplanetary and in heliographic  \n      coordinates (see below). An ASCII formated data set containing key      \n      components of the 48 second magnetic field data and ephemeris data has  \n      been created allowing more convenient access to high resolution Voyager \n      magnetometer data.                                                      \n                                                                              \n    Coordinate System                                                         \n    =================                                                         \n                                                                              \n      Interplanetary magnetic field studies make use of two important         \n      coordinate systems, the Inertial Heliographic (IHG) coordinate system   \n      and the Heliographic (HG) coordinate system.                            \n                                                                              \n      The IHG coordinate system is use to define the spacecraft's position.   \n      The IHG system is defined with its origin at the Sun.  There are three  \n      orthogonal axes, X(IHG), Y(IHG), and Z(IHG).  The Z(IHG) axis points    \n      northward along the Sun's spin axis.  The X(IHG) - Y(IHG) plane lays in \n      the solar equatorial plane.  The intersection of the solar equatorial   \n      plane with the ecliptic plane defines a line, the longitude of the      \n      ascending node, which is taken to be the X(IHG) axis.  The X(IHG) axis  \n      drifts slowly with time, approximately one degree per 72 years.         \n                                                                              \n      Magnetic field orientation is defined in relation to the spacecraft.    \n      Drawing a line from the Sun's center (IHG origin) to the spacecraft     \n      defines the X axis of the HG coordinate system.  The HG coordinate      \n      system is defined with its origin centered at the spacecraft.  Three    \n      orthogonal axes are defined, X(HG), Y(HG), and Z(HG).  The X(HG) axis   \n      points radially away from the Sun and the Y(HG) axis is parallel to the \n      solar equatorial plane and therefore parallel to the X(IHG)-Y(IHG) plane\n      too.  The Z(HG) axis is chosen to complete the orthonormal triad.       \n                                                                              \n      An excellent reference guide with diagrams explaining the IHG and HG    \n      systems may be found in Space and Science Reviews, Volume 39 (1984),    \n      pages 255-316, MHD Processes in the Outer Heliosphere, L.
