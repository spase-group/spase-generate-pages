Coverage begins in the solar wind inbound to Jupiter and      \n    continues past the last outbound bowshock crossing. The data are in      \n    System III (1965) (SYS3) coordinates and have been averaged from the     \n    1.92 second summary data to a 9.6 second sample rate. All magnetic       \n    field measurements are given in nanoTesla (nT). The magnetic field       \n    data are calibrated (see the calibration description included in the     \n    Voyager 1 Magnetometer instrument catalog file for details).             \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n    Parameters                                                               \n    ==========                                                               \n                                                                             \n    The full LFM instrument sample rate is 1 sample per 0.06 seconds.        \n    Full telemetry resolution 'detail' data must be obtained from the        \n    instrument team. For this data set, the data have been resampled to      \n    9.6 seconds from 1.92 second summary data. The 1.92 second data were     \n    in turn resampled from the detail data.                                  \n                                                                             \n    The LFM has eight dynamic ranges.
