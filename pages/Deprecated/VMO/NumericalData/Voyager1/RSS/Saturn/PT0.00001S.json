        "Description": "                                 \n                                                                      \n    Data Set Overview                                                 \n    =================                                                 \n      This data set consists of raw data collected during the Titan   \n      radio occultation of Voyager 1 in November 1980 plus ancillary  \n      files that might be useful in analysis of those data.  The raw  \n      data are sampled voltage outputs from receivers tuned to the    \n      Voyager carrier frequencies at both S-band and X-band during    \n      the occultations.  The data have been reduced to give profiles  \n      of atmospheric temperature and pressure as a function of        \n      height above the surface on both the ingress and egress sides   \n      of Titan [LINDALETAL1983] and to make a marginal detection of   \n      an ionosphere  [BIRDETAL1997].                                  \n                                                                      \n      During the Titan occultation, the Voyager 1 spacecraft          \n      provided a coherent, dual-frequency microwave radio signal      \n      source.  The signal frequency was derived from a precision,     \n      onboard Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The spacecraft          \n      high-gain antenna (HGA) beamed that signal through the          \n      atmosphere of Titan.  As the spacecraft moved on its            \n      trajectory, the radio signal probed different levels in the     \n      atmosphere.  An hour later the signals were received by         \n      antennas of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) on Earth.         \n                                                                      \n      Because the density of Titan's atmosphere was so poorly known   \n      prior to the Voyager encounter, experiment planners did not     \n      know how much refractive bending to expect during the           \n      observations.  Models predicted a range of behaviors from very  \n      little bending to so much that the narrow beam from the         \n      spacecraft high-gain antenna (HGA) would be deflected away from \n      Earth and the surface occultation would not be seen.  Timing    \n      uncertainties in the motion of the spacecraft with respect to   \n      Titan only complicated the problem.  The experiment was         \n      implemented with a very small (0.11 deg) fixed HGA offset       \n      during the ingress occultation and a large (2.36 deg) offset    \n      during egress.  These choices, in retrospect, were very good    \n      given the atmosphere that was found.                            \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    Parameters                                                        \n    ==========                                                        \n      The output of the S-band receiver was a sinusoidal carrier      \n      signal embedded in noise -- a voltage with bandwidth            \n      approximately 50 kHz and sampled at 300000 samples per second.  \n      The X-band receiver output was similar; but, because of greater \n      potential for Doppler drift and prediction uncertainty, its     \n      bandwidth was 150 kHz and sampling rate was 300000 samples per  \n      second.  Voltages typically were in the range +/- 10 volts;     \n      but the absolute levels were not calibrated.  In fact, they     \n      are generally not needed since it is the frequency (or phase)   \n      of the signal (rather than amplitude) that is most useful in    \n      inferring properties of a neutral atmosphere or ionosphere.     \n                                                                      \n      The frequency of the USO was known from monitoring during the   \n      Jupiter-Saturn cruise (and from post-Saturn observations).      \n      Doppler contributions from motions of the spacecraft, Earth,    \n      Titan, and other bodies of the solar system were determined     \n      jointly with the Voyager Navigation Team.  Relativistic         \n      Doppler contributions could be estimated from proximity to      \n      large masses.  Receiver tuning was recorded in POCA             \n      (Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly) files, which are     \n      included with this archive.                                     \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    Processing                                                        \n    ==========                                                        \n      No processing per se has been carried out on these data.        \n      However, because of the high sampling rate, the 8-bit samples   \n      were recorded originally on wide-bandwidth analog video tape.   \n      The analog tapes were then replayed later at slower speeds and  \n      the digital data were extracted and separated onto computer     \n      compatible tapes (CCTs) with S-band and X-band data on          \n      different sets of tapes.  Because the S-band data had been      \n      oversampled originally (300 ksps for a 50 kHz bandwidth), only  \n      one of every three samples was saved during the transfer of     \n      S-band data to CCTs.  This process, known as 'decimation', meant\n      that 300 seconds of data could be stored on an S-band CCT       \n      whereas only 100 seconds of X-band data would fit.              \n                                                                      \n      Because analog recording technology was required to save the    \n      high data rate digital samples, there are occasional dropouts   \n      in the sample stream.  These can be detected by paying special  \n      attention to counter fields in data record headers.             \n                                                                      \n      Two analog recorders (A and B) were available at each DSN       \n      complex.   Because a single recorder could not capture the      \n      entire set of Titan occultation activities, the two were run    \n      in parallel with staggered start/stop times.  Most data were    \n      collected using Recorder A; but Recorder B was used to          \n      capture the samples while Recorder A was being reloaded.        \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    Data                                                              \n    ====                                                              \n      Primary data were delivered to Voyager Radio Science Team       \n      members in the form of 30 megabyte (MB) CCTs covering           \n      300 s (S-band) or 100 s (X-band).  Each tape had  6000          \n      records of 5056 bytes (56 bytes of header information           \n      and 5000 8-bit samples of receiver output voltage).  Tapes      \n      were numbered sequentially as CCTs were generated from the      \n      high density video originals.  Tapes with Titan data from       \n      Recorder A were numbered VJ6281 through VJ6360; tapes           \n      from Recorder B were numbered VJ6361 through VJ6380.  Test      \n      and calibration data after the Titan encounter were collected   \n      on Recorder A and have numbers VJ6589 through VJ6594.           \n                                                                      \n      The original tape numbering has been preserved in the current   \n      file names, which have the form VJnnnnCC.ODR.  On tapes where   \n      one or more records could not be read, the original has been    \n      separated into two or more files.  The character 'C' indicates  \n      the ordering of these file fragments with 'A' being first (and  \n      the default with no tape reading errors), 'B' next, etc.        \n                                                                      \n      Each Original D",
