        "Description": "This data set contains 144 second averages of the electric field\nintensities from the Unified Radio and Plasma Wave\nInstrument Radio Astronomy Receiver.\n\nUnits are microVolt/Hz**0.5 measured at the\nreceiver input terminals.  To convert to electric field strength\nthe given data must be divided by the effective length of the\nantenna.  This is complicated by the fact that the effective\nlength depends on the antenna impedance which is affected by the\nplasma conditions local to the Ulysses spacecraft.  The impedance\nwill also depend on the frequency.  In general, the RAR frequency\nchannels that are well above the local electron plasma frequency\nare not affected by the plasma conditions and the effective\nlength of 23 meters can be used.  When the RAR is in summed,\nrather than separate, mode the determination of field strengths\nis even more difficult.\n\nThe time period of 144 seconds was used for the averaging period\nbecause that is the basic cycling time of the instrument.  The\nRAR continually cycles through a list of frequencies.  There are\n16 lists and the list currently in use is chosen by telecommand.\nThe time period to complete the list is 144 seconds for the high\nband of the receiver (for telemetry bit rates of 1024 and 512\nbps, the cycle time is 64 seconds for bit rates of 256 and 128\nbps), after which the instrument begins with the list again.\nTherefore this period was chosen for the averaging period.\n\nNotes on the Radio Astronomy Receiver\nfrom URAP User Notes\nhttp://helio.esa.int/ulysses/archive/urap_un.html\n\nThe Radio Astronomy Receiver is divided into two parts, a low\nfrequency receiver and a high frequency receiver.  The low\nfrequency receiver has 64 channels that cover the frequency range\nfrom 1.25 to 48.0 kHz in linear steps of 0.75 kHz.  The high\nfrequency receiver has 12 channels that cover the range from 52\nkHz to 940 kHz in approximately logarithmic steps.\n\nThe high frequency receiver is usually operated in what is called\n\"measure\" mode, which causes the receiver to step repeatedly\nthrough a list of frequencies that is determined by a ROM on\nboard the spacecraft.  There are 16 different lists and one of\nthem is chosen by telecommand.  The different lists emphasize\ndifferent frequency ranges, so as to maximize the information\nreceived depending on the type of phenomena being studied.  Some\nof the lists include all 12 possible frequency channels while\nother lists skip some of the frequencies.  The list that has been\nused for most of the mission does include all frequecies, but\nthere may be times when other lists have been used.  At these\ntimes only a subset of the frequencies will be present.\n\nThe low frequency receiver can be operated in measure mode (with\nits own set of lists of 8 or 16 frequencies) or in \"linear sweep\"\nmode where it steps through a contiguous set of frequencies.  In\nlinear mode, all 64 frequencies can be stepped through, or a\nsubset of 32 frequencies can be chosen using the lower half,\nmiddle half, or upper half of the frequencies.  For most of the\nmission, the low frequency receiver has been operated in linear\nmode with all 64 frequencies but there have been periods when it\nhas operated in measure mode or in in linear mode with less than\n64 frequencies.  During these periods only a subset (8, 16, or\n32) of the 64 possible frequencies will appear.\n\nBesides the intensity of a signal reaching the spacecraft, the\nRAR can also, when operated in particular modes, determine\nadditional information about the source of the radiation,\nincluding its direction relative to the location of Ulysses, its\nangular size, and its polarization.  This is most efficiently\ndone with the signal from the X and Z axis antennas summed\ntogether electronically either with or without a phase shift\nadded between the two signals.  Although this additional\ninformation cannot be recovered from the averaged data, the mode\ndoes have a large effect on the background signal level, so the\nmode of high and low frequency receivers is given in the data as\neither summed (X and Z antenna combined) or separate (X antenna\nalone).\n\nReference: Astron.
