        "Description": "\n\tVoyager 1 Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) Highband receiver daily files \n\tduring Jupiter Encounter (1979-02-01 to 1979-04-13). Associated with these binary data are a series of quick-look GIF spectrogram plots created using the binary data. The plots are available for both polarization channels. These binary data were also converted into IDL save sets.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe data set provides 48 second resolution highband radio mean power data\n\tin units of millibels. The high-band receiver consisted of 128 channels of \n\t200 kHz bandwidth each, with center frequencies spaced at 307.2 kHz \n\tintervals from 1.2 MHz to 40.4 MHz. The highband receiver was designed \n\tespecially for the observation of Jovian decametric radio emissions. The \n\tPRA radiometer was usually operated routinely in the so-called POLLO sweeping \n\tmode, in which all 198 frequency channels of the high- and low-band receivers \n\ttogether were swept in 6 sec, dwelling at each channel for 25 msec. From one \n\tstep to the next in the channel switching sequence, the antenna polarization \n\tsense was reversed, i.e., was changed from RH to LH or vice versa. Thus the \n\ttime required for making a measurement of both the RH and LH intensity \n\tcomponents at both senses of elliptical polarization at a given frequency was \n\t12 sec. The data consists of successive averages of 4 pairs of RH and LH \n\tintensity measurements, each average spanning an interval of 48 sec.\n\n\tThe format of these binary data files is as follows:\n\n\tfile separation variable\n\n\tyear, month, day information\n\n\tmillisecond decimal value of the day\n\n\tInteger array (128,2) for 128 left and right channels (NOTE 128 channels for Hi-band; 70 channels for Lo-band)\n\n\tfile separation variable\n \n\tThere is an IDL program that reads these files into an IDL-format save set. See Information URL for a link to this file.\n\t\n                                                          \n      The data are calibrated and are given in units of             \n      'millibels' which is 1000 times the log of the received power.          \n      Zero millbels corresponds to approximately 1.4 x 10^-21 W m^-2          \n      Hz^-1, however, this value is never seen in practice. The               \n      minimum values detected, which includes receiver internal and           \n      spacecraft generated noise, are about 2300 to 2400 millibels,           \n      or about 3.5 x 10^-19 W m^-2 Hz^-1; even higher values are seen         \n      at the very lowest frequencies.                                         \n                                                                              \n\t  Note:     \n      The polarization indicated is the received polarization, not                \n      necessarily the emitted polarization. Correct interpretation of         \n      the received polarization depends on the antenna plane                  \n      orientation relative to the radio source. A good description of         \n      this concept can be found in \n      \n      Leblanc Y., Aubier M. G., Ortega-Molina A.,\n      Lecacheux A., 1987, J.Geophys. Res. 92, 15125 and in \n      \n      Wang, L. and Carr, T.D.,\n      Recalibration of the Voyager PRA antenna for polarization sense \n      measurement, Astron.
