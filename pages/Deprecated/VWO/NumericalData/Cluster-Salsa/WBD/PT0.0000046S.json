        "Description": "The following description applies to the Wideband Data (WBD) Plasma \nWave Receivers on all four Cluster satellites, each satellite being uniquely identified \nby its number (1 through 4) or its given name (Rumba, Salsa, Samba, Tango, \nrespectively).  High time resolution calibrated waveform data sampled in one \nof 3 frequency bands in the range 0-577 kHz along one axis using either an \nelectric field antenna or a magnetic search coil sensor. The dataset also \nincludes instrument mode, data quality and the angles required to orient the \nmeasurement with respect to the magnetic field and to the GSE coordinate \nsystem. The AC electric field data are obtained by using one of the two 88m \nspin plane electric field antennas of the EFW (Electric Fields and Waves) \ninstrument as a sensor. The AC magnetic field data are obtained by using \none of the two search coil magnetometers (one in the spin plane, the other \nalong the spin axis) of the STAFF (Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field \nFluctuations) instrument as a sensor. The WBD data are obtained in one of \nthree filter bandwidth modes: (1) 9.5 kHz, (2) 19 kHz, or (3) 77 kHz. The \nminimum frequency of each of these three frequency bands can be shifted \nup (converted) from the default 0 kHz base frequency by 125.454, 250.908 \nor 501.816 kHz. The time resolution of the data shown in the plots is \ndetermined from the WBD instrument mode. The highest time resolution \ndata (generally the 77 kHz bandwidth mode) are sampled at 4.6 \nmicroseconds in the time domain (~4.7 milliseconds in the frequency \ndomain using a standard 1024 point FFT). The lowest time resolution data \n(generally the 9.5 kHz bandwidth mode) are sampled at 36.5 microseconds \nin the time domain (~37.3 milliseconds in the frequency domain using a \nstandard 1024 point FFT). The availability of these files depends on times of \nDSN and Panska Ves ground station telemetry downlinks. A list of the status \nof the WBD instrument on each spacecraft, the telemetry time spans, \noperating modes and other details are available under Science Data \nAvailability on the University of Iowa Cluster WBD web site at http://www-\npw.physics.uiowa.edu/cluster/ and through the documentation section of \nthe Cluster Science Archive (CSA) (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/csa/documentation). Details on \nCluster WBD Interpretation Issues and Caveats can be found at http://www-\npw.physics.uiowa.edu/cluster/  by clicking on the links next to the Caution symbol \nin the listing on the left side of the web site.  These documents are also available \nfrom the Documentation section of the CSA website.   For further details on \nthe Cluster WBD data products see Pickett, J.S., et al., \"Cluster Wideband \nData Products in the Cluster Active Archive\" in _The Cluster Active Archive_, \n2010, Springer-Verlag, pp 169-183, and the Cluster WBD User Guide \narchived at the CSA website in the Documentation section. ... \n\nCALIBRATION: ... The procedure used in computing the calibrated Electric \nField and Magnetic Field values found in this file can be obtained from the \nCluster WBD Calibration Report archived at the CSA website in the \nDocumentation section. Because the calibration was applied in the time \ndomain using simple equations the raw counts actually measured by the \nWBD instrument can be obtained by using these equations and solving for \n'Raw Counts', keeping in mind that this number is an Integer ranging from 0 \nto 255. Since DC offset is a real number, the resultant when solving for raw \ncounts will need to be converted to the nearest whole number.  A sample \nIDL routine for reverse calibrating to obtain 'Raw Counts' is provided in the \nWBD Calibration Report archived at the CSA. ... \n\nCONVERSION TO FREQUENCY DOMAIN: ... In order to convert the WBD data to the frequency \ndomain via an FFT, the following steps need to be carried out: 1) If Electric \nField, first divide calibrated data values by 1000 to get V/m; 2) Apply \nwindow of preference, if any (such as Hann, etc.); 3) Divide data values by \nsqrt(2) to get back to the rms domain; 4) perform FFT (see Bandwidth \nvariable notes for non-continuous modes and/or the WBD User Guide \narchived at the CSA); 5) divide by the noise bandwidth, which is equal to \nthe sampling frequency divided by the FFT size (see table below for \nappropriate sampling frequency); 6) multiply by the appropriate constant \nfor the window used, if any. These steps are more fully explained in the \nWBD Calibration Report archived at the CSA.... \n\n+--------------------------+ \n| Bandwidth | Sample Rate | \n|-----------|--------------| \n| 9.5 kHz | 27.443 kHz | \n| 19 kHz | 54.886 kHz | \n| 77 kHz | 219.544 kHz | \n+--------------------------+ \n\n\nCOORDINATE SYSTEM USED: ... One axis measurements made in the \nAntenna Coordinate System, i.e., if electric field measurement, it will either \nbe Ey or Ez, both of which are in the spin plane of the spacecraft, and if \nmagnetic field measurement, it will either be Bx, along the spin axis, or By, \nin spin plane.  The user of WBD data should refer to the WBD User Guide, \narchived at the CSA, Section 5.4.1 and Figure 5.3 for a description of the \nthree orientation angles provided in these files.  Since WBD measurements \nare made along one axis only, these three angles provide the only means for \norienting the WBD measurements with respect to a geocentric coordinate \nsystem and to the magnetic field direction ...",
